# WordNet
Developed data structures and algorithms to represent the WordNet semantic network for the English language and allow efficient computation of semantic distance, nearest ancestor (via modified Breadth-First Search) and Outcast detection (identifying which of a list of words is least close to the others in terms of semantic distance)
Completed as original work in weekly assignment form online algorithms class.
References classes from publically available algorithms and data structures package from Princeton University.

Possible future developments:
-Create a UI in Swing or JavaFX and make a simple standalone Java app where user can perform queries using user provided words and sets of words and get results based on WordNet
