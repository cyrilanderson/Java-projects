# BoggleSolver
Boggle solver. Used a 26-way Trie data structure (to hold contents of a dictionary for efficient lookup) and a modified depth-first search algorithm to efficiently explore the search space of valid Boggle words starting from each letter in the board.
Boggle Board class and some other referenced classes from publically available algorithms and data structures package from Princeton University. BoggleSolver and DictionaryTrieST are my original work completed for weekly assignment in online algorithms class.
